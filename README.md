# project-ideas
A repository to collect ideas for useful projects built on top of the OpenAQ Platform or other general air inequality ideas.

This is only a communications repository, no code to be expected. If you have any ideas for things to be built using the API (visualizations, apps, tools, etc.), OpenAQ platform, or other general air inequality ideas [create an issue](https://github.com/openaq/project-ideas/issues) and label it as an idea.

Note: All issues created in this repo are shared automatically on the [OpenAQ Community Slack Channel](https://openaq-slackin.herokuapp.com/).
