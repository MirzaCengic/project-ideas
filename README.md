# project-ideas
A repository to collect ideas for useful projects built with the OpenAQ API.

This is only a communications repository, no code to be expected. If you have any ideas for things to be built using the API (visualizations, apps, tools, etc.), [create an issue](https://github.com/openaq/project-ideas/issues) and label it as an idea.
